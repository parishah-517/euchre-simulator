# euchre-simulator
A Midwest card game simulator in C++ </br>

I implemented a simulator for the game of Euchre so that the game can be played against a Human player or Simple AI player.

I worked with abstract data types, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism. 

I've uploaded the .h files and test files I was given to test my implementation on. 

To view my implementation, email me at shahpari@umich.edu. I'm not able to make my code public due to academic integrity since this project was a course assignment
