# euchre-simulator
A Midwest card game simulator in C++ </br>

Implemented a simulator for the game of Euchre so that the game can be played against a Human player or Simple AI player <br>

Worked with abstract data types, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism. </br>

To view my implementation, email me at shahpari@umich.edu. I'm not able to make my code public due to academic integrity since this project was a course assignment
